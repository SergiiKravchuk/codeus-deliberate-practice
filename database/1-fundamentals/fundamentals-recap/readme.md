# SQL Fundamentals Recap

This module serves as a test of the knowledge gained during the work on Module 1 (Fundamentals).

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

**Block 1 and 3 uses an embedded PostgreSQL database so no setup needed for these blocks** 

### 1. Setup the Database for Block 2

To spin up the database environment, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command starts two containers:

- **PostgreSQL** (database)
- **pgAdmin** (web-based UI for PostgreSQL)

Both are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, located in the root of the project (same level as this README).

---

### 2. Connect to the Database

Once the containers are up:

- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050) to access **pgAdmin**, or
- Use any other PostgreSQL client like **psql**, **DBeaver**, or **DataGrip**

This can be useful to additionally analyze tables and queries from problems form the Block 2.

---

### 3. Navigate to Assessment Blocks

Go to:

```
src/test/resources/queries/
```

Inside, you'll find three folders:

- `block_1/`: tasks related to Concurrency (and Locking - TBA üò¢)
- `block_2/`: tasks related to Query Optimization
- `block_3/`: tasks related to SQL practice

---


## Block 1: Concurrency (and Locking - TBA üò¢)
This block contains 3 problems. Each problem contains a concurrent scenario where you apply correct Isolation level.


#### Goal
Solve all problems by adding a proper Isolation Level for transaction (if needed) and make all tests pass in the `org.codeus.database.fundamentals.recap.SqlQueriesTest.Block_1`.

### Rules
* Do NOT alter files under `setup` folder
* Do NOT alter files under `setup` folder
* Add Isolation Level for transaction 
* Process both files in the problem folder before running tests

### Problems
#### [Problem 1](src%2Ftest%2Fresources%2Fqueries%2Fblock_1%2Fproblem_1)
#### [Problem 2](src%2Ftest%2Fresources%2Fqueries%2Fblock_1%2Fproblem_2)
#### [Problem 3](src%2Ftest%2Fresources%2Fqueries%2Fblock_1%2Fproblem_3)

---

## Block 2: Optimization problems
This block contains 8 problems. Each problem contain a query that you should optimize.

#### Goal
Solve all problems and make all tests pass in the `org.codeus.database.fundamentals.recap.SqlQueriesTest.Block_2`.

#### Rules
* Do NOT alter/insert data in the database
* Do NOT alter or uncomment code in problem files
* Write your solution under `-- WORKING AREA` tag

#### Tips
* Read description of each problem carefully, and analyze what can be done to achieve problems goal;
* Some performance mechanisms may already exist ;
* Problem can have multiple solutions;
* Problem may require removing existing index;
* Use a DB client and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` mechanism to analyze query before tests execution;
* Most problems have small and big hints. Use them wisely.
  * Small hint - light hint to point the direction of thinking;
  * Big hint - contain almost the full answer to the problem. 

#### General Hints

<details> 
<summary>Hint 1: Index related tasks (click to expand)</summary>
Use SQL below to read all created custom indexes:

<code>SELECT tablename, indexname, indexdef FROM pg_indexes WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = '<your_table>' ORDER BY tablename, indexname;</code>

</details>
<details> 
<summary>Hint 2: View related tasks (click to expand)</summary>
Use SQL below to read all created custom views:

<code>SELECT viewname, definition
FROM pg_catalog.pg_views
WHERE schemaname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');</code>
</details>

## Block 3: SQL practice
This block contains a design document and multiple tasks. Each tasks contain a description on query you should write.


#### Goal
Design a small DB following the document design below. Populate your DB using


#### Design Document
Our company needs to store data about **customers**, their **accounts**, and our **bank branches**. 

All branches must have a **Branch ID**, **name**, **street address**, **city**, **state or province**, **ZIP/postal code**, and a **manager's name**. A branch cannot exist without an assigned manager, and the postal code must follow a five-digit format for validation purposes.

Each customer should have a **Customer ID**, **full name**, **email address**, **phone number**, **date of birth**, **mailing address**, and their **home branch** data. The email, as usual, must be unique. Also we should validate phone numbers on matching a valid format, and dates of birth must be in the past. Every customer must be associated with an existing branch.

Accounts represent the relationship between customers and branches. Each account must include an **Account ID**, **owner of the account**, a **branch** where account was open, **account type**, **current balance**, and an **account rating** represented both as a numeric code and a text description (as Bronze, Silver, Gold). Account types are restricted to either 'checking' or 'savings', and balances must be non-negative.

#### Tips
* Pay attention to column requirements
* Use [input_data_sample.md](src%2Ftest%2Fresources%2Fqueries%2Fblock_3%2Finput_data_sample.md) to populate your database.
