     Safe Balance Check Before Withdrawal (Avoid Dirty Reads)
Scenario:
A customer wants to withdraw money from their account. The system must:

Read the current balance from the account.
If the balance is sufficient, deduct the amount.
Insert a withdrawal transaction record.
Commit the transaction.
To prevent dirty reads, the implementation must use at least READ COMMITTED isolation.

Implementation Steps:
Use READ COMMITTED or higher to avoid reading an uncommitted balance change from another transaction.
Ensure the balance is consistent before making a deduction.
Test Case:
In one transaction, start a withdrawal and don’t commit it.
In another transaction, try to read the balance.
The balance should not show uncommitted changes.

3. Credit the receiving account in Bank B.
4. Log the transaction in both banks.

Implementation Steps:

Rollback sp3 if logging fails.
Rollback everything if Bank B fails to credit the account.

- sp2: After inserting the loan entry.
If fee deduction fails, rollback to sp2.
If loan creation fails, rollback everything.

    Exercise 4: Employee Payroll Processing (Multiple Savepoints)
Scenario:
The bank processes employee payroll in three stages:

Deduct the salary from the bank’s payroll account.
Deposit salary into each employee’s account.
Log payroll transactions for compliance.
If step 3 (logging transactions) fails, rollback to step 2.
If step 2 (depositing salary) fails for any employee, rollback only their transaction, not the entire batch.

Implementation Steps:
sp1: After deducting from the payroll account.
sp2: After depositing salaries for each employee.
Rollback sp2 for individual employees if their transaction fails.
Rollback sp1 if bulk salary deposit fails.
